## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## How to Run!

You can download the starter code through either:

-   Memory Game project repository on GitHUB: <https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game>
-   The Zipped File : <https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game/archive/master.zip>

## How I built the  Game!

The Memory Game Project is all about demonstrating your mastery of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This is a complete browser, tablet and mobile based card matching game.

-   created index.html file
-   img folder to store images
-   js folder to save JavaScript file
-   css folder to save css file

I manipulated the DOM and also styled the game

-   created a deck of cards that shuffles when game is refreshed
-   created a counter to count the number of moves made by player and timer to know the duration of a play
-   added effects to cards when they match and are unmatched
-   create a pop-up modal when player wins game

## How it Works!

If you're unfamiliar with the game, the rules are very simple; flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!
The game board consists of sixteen cards arranged randomly in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. Each turn:

-   A player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol
-   The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol
-   If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over
-   If the cards do not match, both cards are returned to their initial hidden state
-   The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.
